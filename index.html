            Chael was the first person to trash talk Anderson who at the time was considered the #1 pound for pound fighter in the world. The great rivalry and the fact that Chael showed Silva no fear is the reason why this made my top 5. Chael beat Silva the whole night until 1:55 left on the clock when Silva came back out of nowhere submitting Chael and winning the fight.

It was then that his father ran onto the track to help his son finish. Then Derek broke down in tears realizing his olympics dreams were over.
